 \caption{Illustration of the method used to estimate saturation Effects. To each LC simulated point (first row) corresponds a seeing (second row) from which a factor corresponding to the highest fraction of energy deposited in a pixel is estimated (third row). We multiply this factor by the exposure time (here 15s) and the flux to estimate (fourth row) the highest signal deposited (in pe) in a pixel.  LC points corresponding to saturation are removed if their fluxes are greater or equal the ccd full well ((red dotted line; 90 kpe).}\label{fig:method}
